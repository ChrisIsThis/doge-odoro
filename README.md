### Live Demo
[See it live here](https://chrisisthis.github.io/doge-odoro/)

### Description
This is [one of the FCC Advanced Front End Development Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-pomodoro-clock). 
This tracker is a convenient way to follow [the Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). You can add 
and subtract time from either your break/work blocks. You can also "paws" or add/subtract time. The timer hinges around a variable 
called "secondsStart" which time is added to or subtracted from. Other states are flipped betwen 1 and 0 (aka paused or not paused, 
started or not)

### Challenges 
The primary challenge here was working with setInterval, pausing it, restarting. 

### Known Issues
- [ ] Non-mobile responsive
- [ ] countdown bumps divs on sides, should be totally locked


### Future Updates
- [ ] Mobile Friendly version
- [ ] Slow background color transitions
- [ ] Moar Doge-ification!
